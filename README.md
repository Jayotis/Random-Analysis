# Lotto 649 Randomness Analysis

### Purpose: Delete the Winning Numbers!

Yes, you read that right. The purpose of this code is to delete the winning Lotto 649 numbers. Why? Because this isn't a gambling device—it's an analysis of a random event, and let's be honest, if it could predict the winning numbers, I'd be on a beach somewhere instead of writing this README.

This project is a demonstration of a thought experiment I had years ago, where I decided to explore the fascinating world of randomness, probability, and the often strange behavior of lottery draws. It's a hobby project, a little escape from my usual governance work, and something I’ve tinkered with over the years. Now it’s out in the wild for others to see if they can make anything of it or just appreciate the intricacies of long-run random events.

## What Does This Code Do?

Good question! Here's the rundown:

1. **Analyzes Lotto 649 Draws:** It takes a deep dive into the draw history, not just counting how often numbers show up, but looking at the sequence of draws and the probabilities of those draws.

2. **Builds Recursive Probability Lists:** After a few hundred draws, the probability lists start to stabilize, so I thought, why not make a probability list of the probability list? And then another one! It’s a bit like Inception, but with numbers.

3. **Back Propagation Summation:** Because why stop at just listing probabilities? The code sums them up through back propagation, adding another layer of analysis that’s as complex as it sounds.

4. **Demonstrates a Thought:** At its core, this project is about exploring a concept I had. It’s not designed to predict winning numbers (sorry, fortune seekers) but to demonstrate how randomness can be analyzed, and maybe, just maybe, reveal some underlying patterns.

## How to Run It

If you're curious to see what this code does, here's how you can get started:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jayotis/Random-Analysis.git
cd Random-Analysis
g++ Random-Analysis.cpp -o Random-Analysis
./Random-Analysis
```
Watch in awe: See the analysis unfold, and remember, this is more about understanding randomness than beating the lottery.
## Why Should You Care?

You probably shouldn’t, unless you’re into algorithms, statistics, or the sheer randomness of life. But if you are, you might find this project intriguing, or at the very least, a fun mental exercise. And who knows? Maybe you’ll find something in the numbers that I missed.
